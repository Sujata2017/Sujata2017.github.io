# Projects

o Project Title : Invoice-Extractor-Gemini-APP
- This is and end-to-end project about Invoice Extractor using Gemini Pro LLM Model and
deployed in Streamlit. User can upload an image and provide input in the prompt. When the
"Tell me about the image" button is clicked, the app processes the input and image, calls the
Gemini model, and displays the response.

o Project Title : LangChain Demo With OPENAI API
- In this project, built an end-to-end language model application with LangChain, and deployed in
Streamlit.

o Project Title : Kidney-Disease-Classification
- In this project, used kidney CT scan images containing both normal images and images with
tumor, and implemented end to end Kidney-Disease-Classification project using MLflow(MLOps
tool, for experiment tracking and model registration) and DVC(for pipeline tracking). Developed
these components: Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Model Trainer, Model Evaluation,
Model Deployment, and deployed this end to end ML application using CI CD pipelines and
GitHub actions using ECR and EC2 instance.
